# Python Projects
Contains all sorts of projects, mainly related to information security. 
Coding for fun and to develop my own skills. 

### BrowserHistory.py
Retrieves browser history from Firefox and Chrome and enables a printing report of the 
found sites, i.e. how many URLs have been through trading sites, or social media. 
Other categories can be added for interest.

### Password generator.py
Using Tkinter, a secure password can be generated with a basic GUI. This is a simple service and is 
offered by multiple password managers and most modern web browsers when entering password. However, in some
cases, local passwords are also needed... Supports combination of letters (Lower- and uppercase), numbers and symbols. 
6-100 characters in length. 

### Steganography example.py
Also using Tkinter, a message can be encoded within an image. The following py-file allows for encoding and decoding. However,
as of now it may only produce encoded .png files. Although, this also means that it can encode jpg/jpeg/png files and save them to .png.
In addition, there's also the possibility of reading the messages.
